# **QVideo:** PyQt5 support for video cameras

**QVideo** is a framework for integrating
video cameras into PyQt5 projects for scientific research.
It simplifies development of hardware interfaces 
that are compatible with Qt and automates developing
widgets that control cameras' properties and operation.
It provides a flexible display widget
and a configurable digital video recorder that work as
a stand-alone camcorder application and can be
integrated into larger projects.
The DVR emphasizes formats that provide lossless compression
and accurate timing.
The display widget supports mouse-aware graphical overlays for
annotations, regions of interest and general user interaction.
