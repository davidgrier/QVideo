## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **`QCamera.registerProperty` / `registerMethod`** — unified registration
  system; subclasses call these in `_initialize` to expose camera parameters.
  The base-class `get`, `set`, and `execute` route through the registry,
  holding `self.mutex` for thread safety.
- **`QCamera.__getattr__`** — attribute-style access to registered properties
  (`camera.fps`, `camera.width`) without declaring explicit Python properties.
- **`QCamera.settings` property** — returns all registered property values as
  a `dict`; the setter applies a dict of values via `set`.
- **`QGenicamCamera`** — rewired to `registerProperty` / `registerMethod`:
  walks the GenICam node tree at initialization and registers every accessible
  feature, with stop/restart logic for protected features encoded in setter
  closures.
- **`QFPSMeter`** — rewritten with a sliding-window algorithm for accurate,
  low-latency frame-rate measurement.
- **`resolutions.py`** — cross-platform camera resolution probing replaces
  the previous static lookup table.
- **`QListCVCameras`** — soft OpenCV dependency with probe fallback.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — developer guide committed to the repository.
- Full test suite: **895 tests**, 0 failures, covering all core modules,
  camera backends, filters, DVR, and utilities.

### Changed
- `QCamera._properties` and `._methods` are now dicts (keyed by name) rather
  than lists; `QCameraTree` reads them to auto-build the property tree.
- `QCamera.properties`, `.methods`, and `.settings` are now `@property`
  descriptors; previously some backends shadowed them as plain methods.
- `QGenicamCamera`: removed bespoke `set`, `get`, `execute` overrides;
  removed explicit `width`, `height`, `fps` Python properties; removed
  `__properties`, `__methods`, `__modes` static helpers.  `IString` is now
  registered alongside the other property types.
- `QGenicamCamera.protected` is now a `set` (was a `list`).
- `QOpenCVCamera`: device properties probed at runtime and registered only
  if the hardware supports them.
- `QListCameras`: enforced override contract; fixed signal guard.
- `QCameraTree`: improved coverage; fixed pyqtgraph `DeprecationWarning`.
- `QDVRWidget`: fixed writer close bug, disconnect safety; added `newFrame`
  signal.
- DVR subsystem: consolidated readers/writers; added HDF5 and OpenCV formats.
- `QFilterBank`: fixed `deregister`; improved docstrings and test coverage.
- `chooser.py`: data-driven dispatch, full docstrings and tests.
- `clickable`: PyQt5/PyQt6 compatibility fix.
- Packaging: switched to `setuptools.build_meta`; added explicit
  `package-dir` map; added optional-dependency groups (`genicam`,
  `picamera`, `dev`).

### Removed
- `cameras/Genicam/nodemap.py` — dead code; logic moved into
  `QGenicamCamera` private static methods (now also removed in favour of
  `registerProperty`).
- Exploratory Jupyter notebooks from `cameras/Genicam/` and
  `cameras/Spinnaker/`.
- `lib/QCameraList.py` — superseded by `QListCameras`.

### Fixed
- `QGenicamCamera._initialize`: removed `try/finally` anti-pattern that
  silently swallowed the `self.name` `AttributeError` and left `protected`,
  `_properties`, and `_methods` uninitialised.
- `QGenicamCamera`: `IProperty` union type now defined inside the
  `try` block, preventing `NameError` when `genicam` is not installed.
- `QGenicamSource.__init__`: no longer forwards `*args` to
  `QVideoSource.__init__`.
- `QVideoSource`: fixed frame-rate reporting and thread-safety edge cases.
